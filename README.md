# Salam

This is an app for you to keep track of recipes you found and what ingredients you have at home.

Inspired by [Supercook](https://www.supercook.com/) and [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/).

## Why make another app that does the same thing?

Paprika felt kinda jank, and I was hoping I can address that.

## What does the name mean?

It's what they call Basil in Indonesian
